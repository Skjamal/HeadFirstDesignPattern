# "Head First Design Pattern" Notes

***Vocabulary:*** <br>
<strong> ***Participants*** </strong>:classes interacting with each other<br>
***Collaboration***: how classes interact with each other<br>
***Consequences*** -tradeoffs of choosing a particular design pattern<br>
***Implementation***- the solution part of pattern<br>
***Sample code***- how to use the pattern (not an implementation of the pattern)<br>
***Known uses***- examples of real usages of the pattern<br>
***Related patterns***-other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern;<br> 
***DESIGN PRINCIPLE***<br>
***Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same (static and dynamic stuff mixed, example- static html and ruby within static). This way you can alter or extend without affecting other parts***<br>
•	Basis of almost every design pattern- every instance variable must represent an object in the class<br>
•	A method should touch an instance variable because it keeps track of state with object<br>
•	Static methods (exception)<br>
•	Classes are independent of each other and don’t refer or modify eachother<br>
•	“They (classes) do one thing well and only one thing”<br>
•	Normalization (pull out the thing that varies)<br>
•	Creates more easily reusable objects<br>
•	Objects delegate parts of their behavior to other objects<br>
***DESIGN PRINCIPLE***<br>
***Application Program Interface-Program to an interface, not an implementation-care more about what the program does and how services can be obtained, NOT the inner workings (code)-What methods are public***<br>
•	Program to a supertype<br>
•	Java interface (a list of methods you can call)<br>
(Example, map is the supertype. Types -hash or concurrent hash map)<br>
•	Can better use polymorphism<br>
•	Can easily change implementation<br>
***DESIGN PRINCIPLE***<br>
***Favor composition over inheritance***<br>
•	Inheritance limits reusability- too much functionality<br>
•	Favor Has-a relationships (has an engine) over is-a relationship (is an engine)<br>
