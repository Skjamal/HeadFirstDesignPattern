# "Head First Design Pattern" Notes


Design Principles:
* Identify differences in aspects of application and separate them (encapsulate)
* allow parts of system to vary between eachother
* Program to an interface, not an implementation- (Java construct interface)
  example: * create behavior classes (ex: quacking for ducks since not all ducks quack, ie. rubber duck)
* Exploit polymorphism by programming to a supertype so that the actual runtime object isn't locked into the code. 
* Program to a Supertype 
  * Example:
    * People (SuperType)
    * Customers, vendors, employee (Subtype)
Interface type: 
* Favor composition over inheritance.
